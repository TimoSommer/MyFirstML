# MyFirstML
A simple and general framework for running and analyzing machine learning methods on data. This repo is thought as the first good starting point for beginners in machine learning. It is focused on using sklearn models on tabular data. At the moment it supports only regression, but classification is easy to add. Many comments are included in the code to help understanding what is going on and how different machine learning models can be used.


## Install the conda environment:
```
conda env create -f MyFirstML.yaml
```
